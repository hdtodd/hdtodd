- 👋 Hi, I’m @hdtodd, or David Todd to humans.
- 👴🏻 I'm a retired former university CIO and chemistry faculty member who also taught computer science.
- 📡 I’m interested in Mac OS X, Raspberry Pi, Arduino, Linux, computer architectures, 433MHz remote sensors, LoRaWAN, photography.
- 🧪 I'm a Theoretical Chemist by training and continue to be interested in molecular orbital calculations ⚛️ and still tinker with old research ideas.
- 🖥 I program in C, beginning Python, some shell work, and some rusty FORTRAN.  I've tried Swift for Apple IOS applications.
- <rusty emoji here> I tried RUST for Pi systems work but decided it wasn't worth the investment for the kinds of work I do.
- 👥 I’d be interested in collaborating on 433 MHz remote sensor data aggregation systems.
- 📫 How to reach me: hdtodd@gmail.com.
